## Tenets of SRE

In general, an SRE team is responsible for the

  - availability, 
  - latency, 
  - performance, 
  - efficiency, 
  - change management, 
  - monitoring, 
  - emergency response, 
  - and capacity planning 

of their service(s)

## Take aways:

- SRE should caps 50% of their time on operational work. The remaining time should be spent on project work. 

!!! note " practices hint"
  Monitor the operational work being done by SRE's and
  
  - redirect operational work to the development team teams, 
  - reassigning bugs and tickets to development managers, 
  - integrate developers in on-call rotations and so on ...
  
  until the load drops to 50% or lower.
