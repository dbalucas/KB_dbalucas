# How I setup my github pages
Hello there :smirk:,

today has been a quite relaxing one, so I used to power to dig a little more to the documentation topic.
After some time I finally figured out how I'd like to have my further documentations and blogs. - for the moment :smiley:

So if you want to check out the technical details - [click here](../../../knowledgebase/GIT/setup_github_pages_mkdocs.md).
