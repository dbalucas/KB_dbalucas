## tenets of SRE

In general, an SRE team is responsible for the

  - availability, 
  - latency, 
  - performance, 
  - efficiency, 
  - change management, 
  - monitoring, 
  - emergency response, 
  - and capacity planning 

of their service(s)

## take aways:

SRE should caps 50% of their time on operational work. The remaining time should be spent on project work until the load drops to 50% or lower again.

!!! note " practices hint"
    Monitor the operational work being done by SRE's and
    
    - redirect operational work to the development team teams, 
    - reassigning bugs and tickets to development managers, 
    - integrate developers in on-call rotations and so on ...
